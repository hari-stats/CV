#### Research Agenda
As enhanced devices at the edge of the network exploit artificial intelligence, even novel computing challenges are raised. In my current research agenda, I investigate all aspects related to distributed intelligent systems for supporting cities and communities, with a strong focus on optimizing decentralized and self-organized infrastructures. My research finds application in several domains, among which smart city, mobility, healthcare, and cultural heritage.

#### Short Biography
I am a Senior Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.iict.res.in/">CSIR-INDIAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY</a> at the Department of Applied Biology.
